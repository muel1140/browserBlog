Naloxone Dispenser is the second group project I had worked in for UX Makers Lab 201.

The objective of this project is to help make naloxone kits more accessible and more useful to people who are overdosing on opioids. To do this, we are designing a dispenser that can be built by common shop owners, municipalities, and restaurant owners. The dispenser can be built with a combination of 3D printing, nuts and bolts, and things laying around the house like a broom stick handle.
