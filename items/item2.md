Thinking in the Box was a group project that I had worked in for UX Makers Lab 201.

We designed a rectangular prism shaped sized box that is designed for introverted people who want an environment in which they can think with ease, without distractions and noises. The goal is to make sure that the box is as light as possible so that it doesnâ€™t take away from its purpose.
